<h3>Quantitative description of protein-ligand interactions</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Function in biochemistry often revolves around a reversible protein-ligand interaction.
$$
\begin{align}
P + L \rightleftharpoons PL 
\end{align}
$$
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$$
\begin{align}
K_a = \frac{[PL]}{[P][L]} \\
\end{align}
$$
A higher value of $K_a$ corresponds to a higher affinity of the ligand for the protein. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$$
\begin{align}
K_a[L] = \frac{[PL]}{[P]}
\end{align}
$$
The ratio of bound to free protein is directly proportional to the concentration of free ligand.
</div>
</div>

<h3>Occupancy of ligand-binding sites</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$$
\begin{align}
\theta = \frac{\text{Binding sites occupied}}{\text{Total binding sites}} = \frac{[PL]}{[PL] + [P]} 
\end{align}
$$
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Substituting $K_a[L][P]$ for $[PL]$
$$
\begin{align}
\theta = \frac{K_a[L][P]}{K_a[L][P] + [P]} = \frac{K_a[L]}{K_a[L] + 1} = \frac{[L]}{[L] + \frac{1}{K_a}}
\end{align}
$$
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">

<div style="flex: 0 0 60%;">
The value of $K_a$ can be determined from a plot of $\theta$ versus the concentration of free ligand, [L].

The [L] at which half of the available ligand-binding sites are
occupied (at $\theta$ = 0.5) corresponds to $\frac{1}{K_a}$.

<h3>Dissociation constant</h3>

$K_d$ is the equilibrium constant for the release of ligand.

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$$
\begin{align}
K_d = \frac{[P][L]}{[PL]} \\
[PL] = \frac{[P][L]}{K_d} \\
\end{align}
$$
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$$
\begin{align}
\theta = \frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}
\end{align}
$$
When $[L]$ is equal to $K_d$, half of the ligand-binding sites are occupied.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
As $[L]$ falls below $K_d$, progressively less of the protein has ligand bound to it.
 
In order for 90% of the available ligand-binding sites to be occupied, $[L]$ must be nine times greater than $K_d$. 
</div>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Dissociation constant</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$K_d$ is used much more often than $K_a$ to express the affinity of a protein for a ligand.

A lower value of $K_d$ corresponds to a higher affinity of the ligand for the protein.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$K_d$ is equivalent to the molar concentration of ligand at which half of the available ligand-binding sites are occupied.

At this point, the protein is said to have reached half-saturation with respect to ligand binding.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
The more tightly a protein binds a ligand, the lower the concentration of ligand required for half the binding sites to be occupied, and thus the lower the
value of $K_d$.
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Protein structure affects ligand binding</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
The interaction is greatly affected by protein structure and is often accompanied by conformational changes.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Carbon monoxide binds to free heme molecules more than 20,000 times better than does O<sub>2</sub> (that is, the $K_d$ or P<sub>50</sub> for CO binding to free heme is more than 20,000 times lower than that for O<sub>2</sub>).
</div>
</div>


<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">

<div style="flex: 0 0 60%;">
CO binds only about 200 times better when the heme is bound in myoglobin.

<div class="fragment fade-in">
The <em>distal His</em> (His<sup>64</sup> E7), does not affect the binding of O<sub>2</sub> but may preclude the linear binding of CO.
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
A reduction in CO binding is physiologically important, because CO is a low-level byproduct of cellular metabolism.

<h3>Enzymes - Introduction</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Much of the history of biochemistry is the history of enzyme research.

Biological catalysis was first recognized and described in the late 1700s,
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
In 1897, Eduard Buchner discovered that yeast extracts could ferment sugar to alcohol, proving that fermentation was promoted by molecules that continued to function when removed from cells. 
</div>
</div>

<aside class="notes">

As vitalistic notions of life were disproved, the isolation of new enzymes and the investigation of their properties advanced the science of biochemistry.

<h3>Most enzymes are proteins</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
James Sumner found that urease crystals consisted entirely of protein, and he postulated that all enzymes are proteins.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
In 1930, J. B. S. Haldane made the remarkable suggestion that weak bonding interactions between an enzyme and its substrate might be used to catalyze a reaction.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
With the exception of a small group of catalytic RNA molecules, all enzymes are proteins.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Their catalytic activity depends on the integrity of their native protein conformation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">

<div style="flex: 0 0 70%;">
<div style="margin-right:-0.8em;">
Some enzymes require no chemical groups for activity other than their amino acid residues.

<div class="fragment fade-in">
An additional chemical component called a <strong>cofactor</strong>—either one or more inorganic ions or a complex organic or metalloorganic molecule called a <strong>coenzyme</strong>.

<h3>Cofactors and coenzymes</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Some enzymes require both a coenzyme and a cofactor for activity.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
A coenzyme or metal ion that is very tightly or even covalently bound to the enzyme protein is called a <strong>prosthetic group</strong>.
</div>
</div>


<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
A complete, catalytically active enzyme together with its bound coenzyme and/or metal ions is called a <strong>holoenzyme</strong>. 

The protein part of such an enzyme is called the <strong>apoenzyme</strong> or <strong>apoprotein</strong>.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Coenzymes act as transient carriers of specific functional groups. 

Most are derived from vitamins, organic nutrients required in small amounts in the diet. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Some enzymes are modified covalently by phosphorylation, glycosylation,
and other processes. 

Many of these alterations are involved in the regulation of enzyme activity.
</div>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Enzyme Classification</h3>

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Many enzymes have been named by adding the suffix “-ase” to the name of their substrate or to a word or phrase describing their activity.
</div>
</div>

<aside class="notes">
Thus urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea, and DNA polymerase catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides to form DNA.

An enzyme known to act in the digestion of foods was named pepsin, from the Greek pepsis, “digestion,” and lysozyme was named for its ability to lyse bacterial cell walls.

Transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to glucose.

Number 2 denote class name (transferase); the second number (7), the subclass (phosphotransferase); the third number (1), a phosphotransferase with a hydroxyl group as acceptor; and the fourth number (1), D-glucose as the phosphoryl group acceptor. For many enzymes, a trivial name is more commonly used—in this case hexokinase.

<h3>How enzymes work</h3>
<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Under biologically relevant conditions, uncatalyzed reactions tend to be slow—most biological molecules are quite stable in the neutral-pH, mild temperature, aqueous environment inside cells.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Many common reactions in biochemistry entail chemical events that are unfavorable or unlikely in the cellular environment, such as the transient formation of unstable charged intermediates or the collision of two or more molecules in the precise orientation required for reaction.
</div>
</div>


<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
An enzyme circumvents these problems by providing a specific environment within which a given reaction can occur more rapidly. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
The distinguishing feature of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is that it takes place within the confines of a pocket on the enzyme called the <strong>active site</strong>.
</div>
</div>

<div class="fragment fade-in">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Often, the active site encloses a <strong>substrate</strong>, sequestering it completely from solution.

The free energy of the ground state of P is lower than that of S, so $\Delta\text{G}^{′°}$ for the reaction is negative and the equilibrium favors P.

A favorable equilibrium does not mean that the S $\rightarrow$ P conversion will occur at a detectable rate (energy “hill” ).

This is the Michaelis-Menten equation, the rate equation for a one-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction. It is a statement of the quantitative relationship between the initial velocity V0, the maximum velocity Vmax, and the initial substrate concentration [S], all related through the Michaelis constant Km. Note that Km has units of concentration. Does the equation fit experimental observations? Yes; we can confirm this by considering the limiting situations where [S] is very high or very low, as shown in Figure 6–12.


This is a very useful, practical definition of Km: Km is equivalent to the substrate concentration at which V0 is one-half Vmax.

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
The best way to compare the catalytic efficiencies of different enzymes or the turnover of different substrates by the same enzyme is to compare the ratio $\frac{k_{cat}}{K_m}$ for the two reactions.

<div class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
$\frac{k_{cat}}{K_m}$ is called the <strong>specificity constant</strong>.

This parameter, sometimes called the specificity constant, is the rate constant for the conversion of E+S to E+P. When [S] << Km.

V0 in this case depends on the concentration of two reactants, [Et] and [S]; therefore this is a second-order rate equation and the constant.

There is an upper limit to kcat/Km, imposed by the rate at which E and S can diffuse together in an aqueous solution. This diffusion controlled limit is 10e8 to 10e9 M-1 s-1

Many enzymes have a kcat/Km near this range (Table 6–8). Such enzymes are said to have achieved catalytic perfection. Note that different values of kcat and Km can produce the maximum ratio
